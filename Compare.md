### Summary: Main Differences Between Hier3D_Chiplet and Cluster3D_Hub

The core difference lies in how they structure the network hierarchy and manage vertical (TSV) connections to reduce cost.

| Feature | **Cluster3D_Hub** | **Hier3D_Chiplet** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Basic Structure** | **Hybrid Mesh/Star.** Each layer has a standard 2D mesh connecting all core routers. On top of this, routers are grouped into 2x2 clusters, and each router in a cluster also connects to a central **Hub Router (HBR)**. | **Partitioned Mesh.** The network is divided into distinct `chiplet` blocks. Routers inside a chiplet are connected in a mesh, but there are no direct mesh links that cross chiplet boundaries. |
| **Vertical Links (TSVs)** | **Hub-to-Hub only.** Vertical links *only* exist between the special Hub Routers of different layers. This creates a very sparse and regular vertical backbone. | **Gateway-to-Gateway only.** Vertical links are restricted to designated **Gateway (GW) routers**, which are part of an inter-chiplet backbone. This is more flexible and models physical chiplet I/O. |
| **Communication Path** | To go to another layer, a packet travels from its source router to its cluster's Hub, up/down the hub-backbone, and then to the destination router. Short-range horizontal traffic can use the base mesh. | To go to another chiplet, a packet must travel from its source router to a Gateway within its own chiplet, across the backbone to a Gateway in the destination chiplet, and then to the final destination router. |
| **Conceptual Model** | Models a **clustered architecture** where a group of cores shares a common, high-speed vertical communication resource (the Hub). | Models a physical, **chiplet-based design** where each chiplet is a self-contained unit with explicit GW routers acting as I/O ports to the rest of the system. |

In short:
*   **Cluster3D_Hub** creates a hierarchy by adding a layer of special Hub routers on top of a standard 2D mesh for vertical communication.
*   **Hier3D_Chiplet** creates a hierarchy by partitioning a 3D mesh and restricting all inter-chiplet communication (both horizontal and vertical) to a backbone network of Gateway routers.
